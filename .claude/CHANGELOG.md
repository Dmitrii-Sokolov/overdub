# CHANGELOG

## 2026-07-15 — Project founded
- Repository initialized, documentation written (README, CLAUDE.md, artifact files)
- Stack and constraints fixed: see DECISIONS.md founding entry

## 2026-07-15 — Stack installed + day-1 TTS bake-off
- Installed local stack on the RTX 4080 Mobile: Ollama 0.31.2 + qwen3:14b,
  faster-whisper (.venv-asr), verified CUDA in both venvs
- Multi-agent stack-verification pass → STACK.md + SETUP.md (verified APIs, VRAM)
- Day-1 ear test on a real video: Chatterbox RU rejected (unusable even without
  cloning); Silero v4_ru adopted — voice eugene, xenia backup. Cross-lingual
  cloning dropped (same-voice premise abandoned). See DECISIONS engine bake-off.
- Experiment scripts: scripts/{day1_smoke_test,no_ref_test,silero_test}.py

## 2026-07-15 — Phase 0 skeleton
- overdub package: CLI, flat-TOML config, per-video workdir, resumable stage
  runner (skip-if-exists, --only/--force); 7 stages (download real, rest stubs)
- TTS engine adapter + SileroEngine (torch.hub v4_ru/eugene, soundfile output)
- Consolidated to one venv (.venv-asr); .venv-tts retired; `pip install -e .`
- Verified end-to-end: `overdub <url> --only download` → source.mkv + source.wav
