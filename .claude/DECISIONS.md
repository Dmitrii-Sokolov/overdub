# DECISIONS

## 2026-07-15 — Founding decisions

**Local-only pipeline.** Target volume is hundreds of hours; cloud TTS pricing
(ElevenLabs ≈ dollars per 20 min) makes remote synthesis economically absurd at
this scale. Local compute is a sunk cost. Trade-off accepted: local Russian TTS
quality is below ElevenLabs.

**Chatterbox Multilingual as the first TTS engine.** MIT license, actively
developed (Resemble AI), voice cloning + emotion control, strongest English
results in blind tests. Known risk: Russian is 6–7/10 with slight accent
artifacts. Silero (native Russian, flat but bulletproof) and XTTS-v2 (best
Russian among cloners, but dead project) come later behind a common interface.
If Chatterbox Russian fails the ear test — switch, don't polish (see PLAN kill
criteria).

**Timing strategy: per-segment TTS + atempo up to x2.** Russian runs 15–25%
longer than English; an x2 compression budget covers ~99% of segments. The user
validated by ear that x2 is acceptable. No smarter time-borrowing logic in v1.

**Local translation (Qwen3-14B via Ollama).** Operationally simpler than cloud
(no keys, no billing, offline), free at any volume. Quality loss vs frontier
models is acceptable for a dubbed track; upgrade path is a URL swap since
Ollama speaks the OpenAI protocol.

**ASR round-trip verification for every TTS segment.** Neural TTS hallucinates
(skips, repeats, mumbles). At hundreds of hours nobody will listen for defects
— the pipeline must catch them itself. Whisper-small transcribes each generated
segment; text mismatch → regenerate with a new seed.

**MKV container with dual subtitles.** Transcript (EN) and translation (RU)
already exist as pipeline artifacts — embedding both as subtitle tracks is
free. MKV over MP4: native SRT support, multiple audio tracks without
container quirks.

**Single-speaker assumption for v1.** Covers ~95% of target content.
Diarization (whisperX + pyannote) would multiply complexity by 2–3x — deferred
until actually needed.

**Rejected: Microsoft local voices.** Windows Narrator natural voices have no
ru-RU voice at all (verified 2026-07); legacy SAPI5 "Irina" is unusable.
Neural Dmitry/Svetlana are cloud-only (edge-tts) — violates local-only.

**Name: overdub.** Real audio-engineering term — laying a new track over an
existing recording, which is literally the final pipeline step.

**Voice cloning first, fixed voice as rollback.** Phase 1 clones the original
speaker (Chatterbox, short reference clip from source audio). This is the
riskiest quality axis — accent artifacts are strongest when cloning from an
English reference — but the payoff (preserved speaker identity) is highest, and
the rollback is trivial: one fixed Russian voice for everything. Decide by ear
after Phase 1; per kill criteria, don't tune reference clips endlessly.

**Custom orchestrator instead of pyVideoTrans / VideoLingo / Pandrator.**
Ready-made dubbing tools cover the happy path but not this project's core
requirements: ASR verification loop, resumable hundred-hour batches, dual
subtitle embedding, local-only pluggable TTS. They stay useful as reference
implementations for stage wiring and edge cases:
[pyVideoTrans](https://github.com/jianchang512/pyvideotrans),
[Pandrator](https://github.com/lukaszliniewicz/Pandrator).

## 2026-07-15 — PoC reframe and timing simplification

**Project stage: research / proof of concept.** Goal is a turn-key pipeline
(URL in → MKV out) proving feasibility; speed and quality must be acceptable,
not production-grade. Kill criteria removed from PLAN — nothing gates; results
are evaluated by ear at the end of Phase 1.

**No tempo cap (supersedes founding x2 decision).** Segments are sped up as
much as their slot requires, at assembly. The translation-shortening feedback
loop is dropped entirely — a few audibly broken segments per video are
acceptable losses for a PoC. Verification runs on raw audio before atempo, so
speed-up never pollutes the verify loop. Per-segment speed factor is logged in
the run report for triage (factor > ~1.8 ≈ candidate for "broken"). The
keep-length prompt instruction stays — it keeps typical factors near 1.0–1.4
for free.

**Context-aware sentence translation.** Whisper segments are not translation
units — they cut mid-thought and lose coreference. Word timestamps → sentence
re-segmentation → sentences translated in order with a rolling context window
(previous EN sentences + their RU translations). Rejected alternative:
whole-transcript translation — better prose, but re-aligning free-form RU text
to timestamps is a hard problem; 1:1 sentence mapping keeps sync trivial.

**Two text fields per sentence.** `text_ru` (raw translation → subtitles) and
`text_tts` (normalized: numbers/acronyms/Latin → Russian words → TTS input).
ASR verification compares against `text_tts` with the same normalizer applied
to both sides — comparing whisper output against raw text would loop forever
on every normalized token ("джи-пи-ю" vs "GPU").

**Per-video loop for PoC.** The stage runner processes one video through all
stages (≈3 model load/unloads per video — minutes of overhead, noise next to
synthesis time). Per-stage batching (one model load per stage per batch) is
deferred to Phase 2; artifact-driven resumable stages make the switch a loop
reorder, not a rewrite.

**VRAM constraint amended.** whisper-small (~0.5 GB) is co-resident with the
TTS engine during synthesis + verification; the one-heavy-model-at-a-time rule
applies to whisper large-v3 / Qwen3-14B / TTS.

**EN→RU fixed.** Source is always English, output always Russian. No language
detection or multi-language handling anywhere in the pipeline.
